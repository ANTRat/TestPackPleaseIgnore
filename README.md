_Test Pack Please Ignore_ - Minecraft Modpack
===============

A public repository for all changes to the pack.

We have a subreddit at http://www.reddit.com/r/TestPackPleaseIgnore/ . Thanks for reading!

Information
===============
_Test Pack Please Ignore_ is a third-party FTB pack made by members of the /r/FeedTheBeast subreddit, officially sanctioned by Slowpoke in late 2013.

To get the pack, enter the code __MegaSharkPunch__ into the FTB private packs option.

This pack runs best with at least 2.5 GB memory, and 256 MB of permgen. Permgen is automatically set by the FTB launcher, but to set the permgen in a different launcher add the following java parameter: __-XX:PermSize=256M__


When you enter a new world, our book, like the Tinker’s Construct one, will show up in your inventory. ___Read it!___


Reporting Bugs
===============
Submit ___all___ bug reports on this github.

To open up an issue: click the issues tab on the right side of the page. Once there, click the “new issue” green button near the top right of the screen in the issues menu, and fill out the subject/title and the body paragraph. 

What does a good bug report look like?

1. Steps to reproduce.
2. If the game crashed, or if one of the developers ask you to, a copy of your log on some sort of paste website. I recommend http://paste.ubuntu.com/, to allow for maximum characters.
3. Screenshots, if the issue warrants it and for clarification.

Any questions/comments/concerns can be brought up on our IRC _[here](http://webchat.esper.net/?channels=TestPackPleaseIgnore&prompt=1/#btn)_. 

For everything else you need to know, you can find the information on our own subreddit _[here](http://www.reddit.com/r/testpackpleaseignore)_.

MOST IMPORTANTLY, have fun :)
