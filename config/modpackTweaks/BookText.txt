**This is the file that TPPI Tweaks reads its info from, it is used for changelogs and information on the modpack**
**To add to the file, type what you want, and separate pages by using the phrase ~~~ **
**The code will interpret "~~~" as a page break, and format the book accordingly**
**In addition, adding a "~" to the end of a line will add a line break**
**Two asterisks at the beginning of a line is a comment**
**Three asterisks and a number will skip that amount of lines following**

***12
Example:
This is some very useful info
And I am typing it on multiple lines
to make this text file easier to read.
These lines don't have line breaks between them
in the book though because they don't end with "~".
~~~
Now I am on page 2~
Now I am one line down~
~
Now I am after a blank line

**Begin book text after asterisks**

Greetings everyone, and welcome to Test Pack Please Ignore!~
~
We, here, at the TPPI headquarters really excited to bring this pack to you all.~
~~~
We also couldn't have done so without the Feed The Beast subreddit community, 
who the pack is made by and for.~
~
Thank you all so very much for making TPPI possible!
~~~
So, your first question probably is, "What is this book?"~
Well, this book you're reading is added by our own custom mod, TPPI Tweaks.~
~
TPPI Tweaks is our own custom mod that allows us to change a bunch of different things within each mod.~
~
Should you want a new copy, check the recipe in NEI.~
~~~
Using both configs and TPPItweaks allows us to heavily configure this pack to our liking;
which is overall stability and balance. (No, this is not GT doing everything, it's us)
Not balance as in make everything so difficult you never want to play, but balance 
(being the heavily subjective term that it is) as in everything is useful.~
~~~
To see a full list of tweaked recipes, type "Tweaked" in NEI. To see the remaining list
of things that are tweaked (not recipes), you can find that at the end of this book.~
~~~
Another feature of TPPI Tweaks is the in-game commands it adds.~
~
The changelog can be found by typing /tppi changelog, which will of course always 
be up to date, no need to ever get a new copy.~
~
We're also working on a project to add in-game documentation for all 
the mods in the pack, to be accessed via commands.~
~~~
Type /tppi guide to receive an all-around guide to the documentation system, 
which is the easiest way to obtain info on any mod you wish.~
~~~
Type /tppi mods <modname> to get an individual book for a mod, or to get
a link if the mod has not had in-game documentation written for it yet.~
/tppi mods list will give you a list of all mods that are possible to be used in the command.
~~~
Naturally, this is a big job, and it's not yet finished, but we're getting close!
~
Our community is already getting 
involved in documenting these mods via our mod's system.~
~
If you'd like to help out with this documentation project or any other parts of TPPI's 
development, feel free to type the command /tppi getInvolved to learn more.
~~~
Lastly, TPPI uses a very heavily modified ore generation system. To check it out, type /tppi ores
for an ingame guide book.
~~~
That's about it. Have fun!~
